<body>
Im a small roskilde based company based in making all sorts of funny nicknacks and functional art.
Focused on making handmade and  durable designs and decorations, mainly working in metal and wood. I aim to use high quality materials, shaped with great expertise, as I pride myself on good handwork.
Iâ€™ve been working with my hands since i was kid, always building and creating things. Been working as a farrier for 9 years and armour designer for 4 years. Been competitive in costume designs and creations for more than 10 year. Winning prices in several countries. All things that eventually has led me to this place in life, where i have my little workshop, working to pay the bills with my hands.
